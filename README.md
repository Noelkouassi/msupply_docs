# mSupply Documentation

This repo contains the public documentation for mSupply, hosted on [docs.msupply.foundation](https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/introduction/).
Documentation is stored in markdown files and built using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

## Getting Started

To edit the docs, first clone this repo locally. Then install zola: https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/

You should be able to run the docs locally now, by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory you've cloned into and entering

```
zola serve
```
