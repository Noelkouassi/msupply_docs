### Telegram Messenger notifications for mSupply Cold Chain 

Telegram Messenger is a free application that can be used on Android or iOS phones and tablets. 
It can also be used on Windows, Linux and Mac computers. 

mSupply Cold Chain notifications are broadcast on dedicated <a href="https://telegram.org/faq_channels
">Telegram channels</a>. 

Channels are very configurable - they can broadcast notifications from a single facility or they can broadcast from multiple facilities. They can broadcast from a single piece of Cold Chain Equipment (CCE) within a facility or they can broadcast from multiple pieces of CCE within a facility. 

Users can subscribe to a single Telegram channel or they may subscribe to multiple Telegram channels, depending on their monitoring requirements. 

Here are some example configurations that are achieveable with mSupply Cold Chain: 

#### A single Telegram channel receiving notifications from all CCE at all facilities. 

This configuration allows for notifications for all CCE at all facilities to be broadcast to a single Telegram channel. 

All users in this scenario have subscribed to this single channel and so all users will see all notifications from all CCE at all facilities.

#### Multiple Telegram channels receiving notifications from all CCE at a single facility each. 

This configuration allows for separate Telegram channels for each facility. Users may subscribe to the facility that they are interested in monitoring. 

Here User 3 has subscribed to two channels.
