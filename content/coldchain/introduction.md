mSupply Coldchain is an Android application that uses low cost Bluetooth temeperature sensors to monitor fridges and freezers in warehouses, hospitals and health centres.

It integrates with mSupply Desktop and the mSupply Dashboard to provide a comprehensive solution that alerts users to breaches in multiple ways, and provides information not just on temperatures, but also on what stock is affected by any breaches.
