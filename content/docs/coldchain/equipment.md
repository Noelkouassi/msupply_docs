### Importing And Exporting

Cold chain assets can be imported from a csv file using the 'Import' button

<p align="center">
    <img src="/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_import_button.png" width="550" height="280">
</p>

This will open an import modal.

<p align="center">

An example template comma-separated-value (csv) is available for download here:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/docs/coldchain/images/equipment_import_template_download.png" width="750" height="420">
</p>

When accessing the import modal from central server, cold chain assets can be imported for a number of stores at once. In this case there will be a store column on the template example, and this field will be required.

The code of the store should be entered in this field.

Data will need to be converted into the format of the csv template provided in order for Open mSupply to be able to process and upload this data.

A csv file can be uploaded once it has been created in the example format.
