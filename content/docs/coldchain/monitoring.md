The Monitoring section displays cold chain monitoring data in three different views:
1. A chart view which shows a summary of data from all sensors
2. A list of all recorded breaches
3. A list view of all temperature logs

### Viewing Monitoring data

Choose `Cold chain` > `Monitoring` in the navigation panel.

![goto monitoring](/docs/coldchain/images/goto_monitoring.png)

This page contains three tabs, displaying different views of temperature monitoring data. The tab which will be displayed by default is the `Chart` tab.

### Chart

![Chart view](/docs/coldchain/images/chart_view.png)

The chart tab displays a chart showing all configured sensors. You can filter the data displayed by:

- Sensor name
- Location
- Date/Time Range
- Breach type

To add a filter to the page, choose the required filter from the drop down. 

![Filter](/docs/coldchain/images/log_filter.png)

If the sensor has recorded a breach - an icon will be shown on the chart. Clicking on the icon displays information about the breach, with a button which takes you to the list of all breaches:

![Chart Breach](/docs/coldchain/images/chart_breach.png)

To close the popup, click the red x in the top right corner.

Also shown on the chart are red (top) and blue (bottom) shaded areas. These show the standard temperature breach threshold values of 2°C and 8°C. Note that your environment may be using different threshold values, so you may have breaches which are outside of these ranges!

### Breaches

The breaches tab displays a list of all recorded breaches. 

![Breaches](/docs/coldchain/images/breaches_list.png)

The list of breaches is divided into 10 columns:

| Column              | Description                      |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------- |
|                     | An icon showing an alert if this breach is unacknowledged        |
| **Status**          | The breach status can be `Acknowledged` or `Unacknowledged`     |
| **Sensor name**     | Name of the Sensor               |
| **Location**        | Current location assigned to the sensor |
| **CCE**             | Name of the cold chain equipment item which the sensor is associated with   |
| **Breach start**    | Date and time at which the breach started |
| **Duration**     | The duration of the breach, if it has ended. If the breach has not ended then `Ongoing` is shown |
| **Type**     | The type of the breach: this is a combination of Hot or Cold (shown by the icon and text colour) and Consecutive or Cumulative |
| **Temperature**     | The temperature recorded when the breach was updated, which is the start or end of the breach (if the breach has ended) |

You can filter the data displayed by:

- Sensor name
- Location
- Date/Time Range
- Type
- Acknowledged

To add a filter to the page, choose the required filter from the drop down.

1. The list can display a fixed number of sensors per page. On the bottom left corner, you can see how many sensors are currently displayed on your screen.

2. If you have more logs than the current limit, you can navigate to the other pages by tapping on the page number or using the right of left arrows (bottom right corner).

3. You can also select a different number of rows to show per page using the option at the bottom right of the page.

![Rows per page](/docs/introduction/images/rows-per-page-select.png)

### Log

The log view shows a list of all temperature logs.

![Logs](/docs/coldchain/images/log_list.png)

The list of temperature logs is divided into 6 columns:

| Column              | Description                      |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| **Date time**       | Date and time of the most recent activity for this sensor     |
| **Sensor name**            | Name of the Sensor               |
| **Location**        | Current location assigned to the sensor |
| **CCE**             | Name of the cold chain equipment item which the sensor is associated with   |
| **Temperature**    | The most recent temperature reported by the sensor         |
| **Breach type**     | If the sensor has had a breach, this shows the type of the most recent breach. This is a combination of Hot or Cold (shown by the icon and text colour) and Consecutive or Cumulative. |

You can filter the data displayed by:

- Sensor name
- Location
- Date/Time Range
- Breach type

To add a filter to the page, choose the required filter from the drop down.
