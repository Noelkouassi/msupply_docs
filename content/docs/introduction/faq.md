#### Can you have multi-stores on one tablet with Open mSupply?

*Mark Prins, [1/02/2023 at 16:33:31]:*

Cool!
Thanks Mark!

#### and bonus question: multiple users on multiple Open mSupply tablets can access the same store concurrently - is that right?

*Andrei Evguenov, [1/02/2023 at 16:38:27]:*
#### yes but there are limitation (wouldn't automatcially see updates to invoice if both users have it open)

*Adam Dewey, [1/02/2023 at 16:38:41]:*
oh yeah, that's great!

#### and I think the user wonâ€™t know that somebody else is updating the invoice right ?

*Adam Dewey, [1/02/2023 at 16:38:53]:*
#### and not dependent on any 4D concurrent licenses?

*Richard Moizeau, [1/02/2023 at 16:39:11]:*
