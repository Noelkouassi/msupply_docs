Creating a New Patient 

mSupply can create a patient file that will hold all the necessary information to dispense medicine(s) to. To create a new patient file, click on 'dispensary' and then the 'patients' icon from the Dashboard:

This will bring up the 'Patient' page. To input the information of a new patient into mSupply, click on the 'New Patient' button. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/module-hiv/images/New_Patient.png)

Here you will find the option to search for an existing patient so you can dispense the necessary medicine to the correct patient, and the information will be documented and inform mSupply.

Click 'OK & Next' to bring up all matching criteria, such as in the example below:

To create a new patient, simply place all the relevent information of the patient in the 'New Patient' tab. Thsi will bring up the option to include the name, date of birth and national health ID among other details.

The information can now be used to find the patient file at a later date. After clicking on the 'OK & Next' you can then access the 'Create' option, that will transfer all the information previously input into a new tab that allows/requires more detail:

Searching for a Patient 

When in the 'Dispensary' menu a comprehensive list of exisitng patients will appear. 

![Stock: nav](/docs/module-hiv/images/Search_Patient.png)

Clicking on a patient name will bring up the patient's details.

In the same 'Patient' menu, search bars are above the patient list that can be used to narrow and specify the search. You can search by both first and last name as well as by ID. This can be useful to quickly find patients with common names or if there is a large number of existing patients.

Export Patient List

mSupply allows the option of exporting patient data to be sent to a non-mSupply user. This will begin the download of an excel file with the basic details of patients:

1) First name
2) Last name
3) National ID

This can be done by clicking on the 'Export' option in the corner of the main 'Patient' menu.
