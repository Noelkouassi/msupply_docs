Inbound Shipments can be used to receive stock from suppliers. 

An Inbound Shipment can be:
* **Automatic**: when you are receiving from another store using mSupply
* **Manual**: when you are creating an Inbound Shipment *ad hoc*

To access the **Inbound Shipment** menu, go to the **Replenishment** menu in the navigation panel and click on **Inbound Shipment**.
