In mSupply, a supplier is an entity that is sending stock to your store. 

<div class="omsupdate">
At the moment, you are only able to view your supplier and their details. In the future, you will be able to create and edit your customers (provided you have the authorisations to do so!).

## Viewing Suppliers
