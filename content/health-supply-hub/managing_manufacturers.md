### Manufacturers

Identifying the correct final dose form manufacturer is an important step to ensure customers understand the product being supplied.

The Health Supply Hub maintains list of manufacturers to select from. If the manufacturer you require is not on the list, please fill out the manufacturer request form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv8Mmin1SXuJwD7MDALEYb648Nrb_XvLpBUer8YIhdwR9NpA/viewform?usp=sf_link), or if you have a number of manufacturers to add, please email health-supply-hub@msupply.foundation attaching the list of manufacturers to add.

While waiting for the updated manufacturer list, or if pressed for time. You can enter "Manufacturer Not On List" in the manufacturer field and include the real manufacturer name in the comment field so the purchaser can update their records when the manufacturer is added.

Note: Purchasers may consider failure to provide valid manufacturer information when accessing your quote.
