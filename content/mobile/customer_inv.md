An example:
a medical centre, called Ami CHC, sends an order to your facility. They are doing an outreach tour to households in a nearby village and would like to collect some items to take.

The **customer** is Ami CHC

They have ordered:

  * Amoxicillin 500mg tabs x 11
  * Paracetamol 500mg tabs x 100
  * Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml x 50

**Let's create a customer invoice**

### Click on Customer Invoices

The **Customer Invoice** button will bring up a list of invoices. If you haven't finished working on an invoice and you have not confirmed it, you can click on it now to bring it up and keep working on it.

----
### Add items to the customer invoice

You can add items to the customer invoice one by one - to do this, tap on **New Item**.

[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_new_item.png?w=800&amp;tok=e78f8c" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_new_item.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

Start typing to search for the item.
[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:search_item.png?w=800&amp;tok=d1403b" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:search_item.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

If you have a lot of items to add to the invoice, it can be slow to add them one by one.

To add a lot of items at once, click **Add Master List Items**.
[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_add_master_list_items.png?w=800&amp;tok=166c2a" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:customer_invoice_add_master_list_items.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

Select one or more master lists from the list. Only master lists visible to the customer are shown.

[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:select_master_list.png?w=800&amp;tok=2d69d9" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="800" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:select_master_list.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Acustomer_inv)

The items on the selected master list(s) will then automatically appear in the customer invoice.

### When you have finished

Click the **Finalise** button at the top, and then **Confirm**.
----### What is a Master List?
