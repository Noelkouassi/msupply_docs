If you are using mSupply mobile for registering participants, dispensing vaccines, and recording adverse events, then you need a mechanism to report on all this information, and to manage your program.
The mSupply dashboard is your friend. We have created a series of dashboards specifically for these tasks.
Here's an example

[<img src="/_media/en:mobile:user_guide:pasted:20210330-074743.png?w=1000&amp;tok=22ce3b" class="mediacenter" loading="lazy" alt="" width="1000" />](/_detail/en:mobile:user_guide:pasted:20210330-074743.png?id=en%3Amobile%3Auser_guide%3Avaccination_dashboards)

Here the dashboard shows a list of people needing to be contacted for their 2nd dose (This can be exported to excel and uploaded to an SMS sending service to send a reminder)
