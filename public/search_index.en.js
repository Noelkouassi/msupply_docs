This is how much stock your store uses each month on average (based on a configurable number of months, defaults to 3 months).\nMonths of Stock: Number of months of consumption left with current stock. This is calculated as: Stock on Hand / AMC.\n\n\nIn below example, we have 1542 units of Amoxicillin available in our store. The average consumption is 53.3  units per month which means that there is the equivalent of 28.9 months of stock in the inventory. \n\n\nIn the bottom part, item details are divided into several sections:\nDetails\n\nName: This is the name by which mSupply will refer to the item\nCode: This should be unique for each item and is a helpful shorthand for referring to items\nUnit: The unit you use for this item. It is useful to distinguish items you issue by pack (eg. eye drops) from items you issue by volume (eg. oral liquids)\nStrength: For a medicine, the concentration of its active ingredients (eg. for Amoxillin 250mg, the strength is 250mg)\nDefined Daily Dose: The assumed  average maintenance dose per day for a medicine used for its main indication in adults\nDoses: For vaccines, the number of dose per vial\nVaccine (check box): If this is checked, this item is a vaccine and a number of dose can be assigned\n\nCategories\n\nATC Category: ATC stands for Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical and is a method of classifying entities, and identifying them by category\nUniversal Name: if the item is linked to the universal drug code database, this shows the universal, or generic name for the given item\nUniversal Code: similarly, the code allocated to the universal drug code item\n\nPackaging\n\nDefault pack size: This is the default pack size that will be assigned to incoming stock as it is received\nOuter pack size: The number of units in a carton (outer pack).

This is the volume that will be used by default when receiving goods. We recommend you divide a carton volume by the number of preferred pack size packs in a carton to get this figure. Open mSupply always stores volumes in m3 (cubic metres), but you can enter a volume as millilitres (ml) or litres (l) by entering the appropriate abbreviation after the number representing the volume. e.g. enter “0.5l” to enter a volume of 0.5 litres (= 0.0005m3).\nVolume per outer pack: The default volume of an Outer pack size pack of this item\nWeight: The weight of a preferred pack size pack in kg\n\nPricing\n\nMargin: This is the default margin that will be applied to this item on Inbound Shipments to calculate the selling price\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/items/","title":"Items"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/master-list/":{"body":"Master lists are standard lists of items that can only be defined at the central server level. \nViewing Master Lists\nGo to Catalogue &gt; Master Lists in the navigation panel: \n\nYou will see a window like this: \n\nTo view all the items of a master list, simply tap on one: \n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/master-list/","title":"Master Lists"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/dashboard/":{"body":"Too many Dashboards!\nYes, we use the term Dashboard for more than one thing.\nOpen mSupply has a landing page which gives an overview of some statistics, and has some useful links, which we're talking about here, and also a system dashboard that uses Grafana, and gives an overview of all sites in your country (or organisation).\nWhat's on display?\n\nYou can see some statistics for shipments and stock:\n\nInbound Shipments\n\nToday Shows the number of inbound shipments created today\nThis week The number created during the current week\n\n\nOutbound Shipments\n\nToday The number of shipments to be picked today, that is, the number with the status of Allocated\n\n\nStock\n\nExpired The number of stock lines in the current store which have expired\nExpiring soon The number of stock lines in the current store which will expire within the next three months\nTotal items A count of the number of items in this store\nItems with no stock The item is visible in this store, but there is no stock recorded\nLess than 3 months of stock Which is based on the average monthly consumption (AMC) for this item in the current store\n\n\n\nAs well, there are buttons toward the bottom of the page which allow you to create shipments and requisitions.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/dashboard/","title":"Dashboard"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/","title":"Distribution"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/customers/":{"body":"\nAt the moment, you are only able to view your customers and their information.

Tab)\n\n\nExample: For the item *030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs*, there are 3527 tabs available. \n\n\nIssue [Quantity] of units in packs of [Pack Size]\nIn the Issue Quantity field, you can enter the quantity that you want to issue to your customer. \nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units. However, you have the possibility to issue a quantity of packs instead by changing the value in the second dropdown (Pack Size). \nDefault value is Any when you are issuing units. \n\nList of available batches:\nThis is a list of batch numbers that you have in store for this item: \n\n# Packs: Number of packs to be issued\nPack Size: Quantity of units per pack\nUnit Qty: Total quantity of units to be issued\nAvailable: Number of packs available (not already allocated to other shipments)\nIn store: Total number of packs in your store\nBatch: Batch number. It is a designation given to products made in the same manufacturing run. \nExpiry: Expiry date of the batch (format: MM/YYYY)\nLocation: If you inventory is managed with storage locations, the name of the location where the item is stored\nSell: Selling unit price of the item\nOn Hold: Indicate whether a batch is on hold or not. You cannot issue a batch that is on hold. \nPlaceholder: The placeholder line is used when the quantity you are issuing is higher than your available stock\n\n\nIssue a quantity of units\nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units, regardless of the pack size (number of units in a pack). \nWhen entering a number in the Issue Quantity field, system automatically chooses the batch number(s) with the shortest expiry date (First to Expire, First Out or FEFO logic). \n\nIn below example, we are issuing 100 units of the item. All 100 units will be taken from the same batch (second row). First batch was not selected because it is expired. \n\n\n\nIn this other example, we are issuing 1200 units. System selects two batches with different pack sizes. \n\n\nNote that in this list, the batches which are available for selection are shown first and batches which are not (on hold or no stock available) are shown below and in a grey font.\nIssue a quantity of packs\nYou can decide to issue a quantity of packs. To do this, you can change the value in the Pack Size dropdown. \n\nLet's imagine that your customer only wants pack size of 12 units. You can change the dropdown value from `Any` to `12`. \n\n\nYou are now offered to issue a number of packs of 12 units. Only batch number(s) with a pack size of 12 units can be automatically issued.\n\nIn below example, we are issuing 10 packs of 12 units:\n\n\n\n if you had previously entered a quantity of units and you switch to a quantity a packs, the quantity of units will automatically be converted into the correct quantity of packs.  \n\n\nWhen a pack size is selected, and stock lines which have a different pack size are not available for selection. As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK. \nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the # Packs column. \nThe main Issue Quantity field will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  when allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers. \nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation. \n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, system is issuing a 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is higlighted in blue. \n\nConfirm Item and Quantity\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button. You are redirected to the Outbound Shipment view and your item has been added to the list. \nthe OK &amp; Next button to add another item right away\nthe Cancel if you do not want to add the item to the Outbound Shipment anymore\n\nEditing an Outbound Shipment Line\nTo edit an shipment line, tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status lower than Shipped. \n\n\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit. \n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit.\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list. \nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs\n\n\n\n  You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer. \nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line: \n\n\nWhen adding items, system is automatically assigning stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines). \n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines: \n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right on the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected lines and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not. \n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to it). You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. \n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation\nOnce you all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines). \n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button. \n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfillment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pickslip indicates:\n\nWhat are the items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched. \nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button. \n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfillment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct. \nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This a critical step cause when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer part of your inventory records. \nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button. \nOnce shipping has been confirmed: \n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are  no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you wil be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now part of their inventory\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound-shipments/","title":"Outbound Shipments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/requisitions/":{"body":"When a customer orders stock from you, they create an Internal Order in their store.

You can implement mSupply in one facility, knowing that if you later decide to deploy thousands of sites, mSupply will still be the right tool.\n\nTo get some insight into the full breadth of mSupply's functionality, have a look at the legacy mSupply software documentations at https://www.msupply.org.nz - it's almost 1000 pages if you print it all (so maybe don't ☺️)\nTerminology\nThe following table outlines some of the common terms used in mSupply, and also guides users of legacy mSupply regarding terminology improvements we have made.\nOpen mSupply TermLegacy mSupply termDefinition\nOutbound ShipmentCustomer InvoiceThe creation of a supply of goods to a particular customer (facility)\nInbound ShipmentSupplier InvoiceThe receiving of a supply of goods from a particular supplier\nRequisitionCustomer RequisitionsAn order for supply of goods made by a particular customer (facility)\nInternal OrdersSupplier RequisitionsA request for stock made for a particular supplier (facility)\n\nGetting Started\nIf you are running the server for the very first time, you may see this screen:\n\nDon't panic!

You can use this feature to force mSupply to always suggest issuing stock of this item from the 'issue' location rather than this 'bulk' location. When you have finished issuing stock from the 'issue' location, and you want to issue the stock that is in the 'bulk' location, you will need to either take the 'bulk' location off hold, or, move all, or some of it (split), the stock from the 'bulk' location. \n\nEditing a new location\nTo edit a location, simply tap on one in the location list. \nDeleting a location\nTo delete a location:\n\nCheck the box of the location that you want to delete in the location list\nClick on the Select dropdown menu and select Delete selected line\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/locations/","title":"Locations"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":"mSupply will automatically keep track of your stock levels for you, as you receive and distribute it.

It can run on windows, mac or linux operating systems.\nHardware Requirements\nGeneral hardware recommendations\n\n\nIn environments with regular power outages, it is highly recommended to procure Laptop machines rather than desktop machines. Laptop machines will almost always be the best solution in terms of both cost and effectiveness for these reasons:\n\nIn environments with poor quality electricity supply, laptop computers will generally be more reliable than desktop computers with UPS protection. In such environments UPS batteries will normally die within 2 years. Laptop batteries have better power management and the batteries last longer\nEven when the battery runs out on a laptop, the power management will normally cause the machine to shut down gracefully. \nLaptop computers have built-in microphone and camera for provision of support\nLaptop computers have built-in Wi-Fi adaptor for network connection\nLaptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers, and so are less costly to ship.\n\n\n\nA connected printer is not absolutely necessary in every situation, but for most situations it is a requirement. An ink-jet or laser is preferable.\n\n\nBuy hardware for which good after sales support is available\n\n\nBuy brands with a reputation for quality (even if it means buying a slower/older machine)\n\n\nWindows and Mac hardware requirements\nHardware requirements vary widely depending on what you want to use Open mSupply for. Here's a rough guide:\n\nRecording stock transactions is a core Open mSupply activity. Most stock transaction data is numeric. It is essential that Open mSupply Windows or Mac hardware include a numeric keypad, either as part of a wide keyboard, or as a dedicated external numeric keypad.\n\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volumeAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\t64 bit processor64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+32+ Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\n\nSmart UPS\nA 'smart' UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detects when the battery power is about to run out and sends a notification to software on the server which triggers a graceful shut down of the computer. To enable this, there needs to be a cable connection (normally USB) between the UPS and the computer combined with software running on the computer.\n\nIn our experience, the primary cause of computer hardware failure is data corruption due to ungraceful shutdowns. This happens when power to the computer is cut instantly, without any notification to the computer to shut down gracefully. If the machine is 'protected' by a normal UPS, then this can still happen when the battery power runs out. Even if the machine is notionally protected by a 'smart' UPS, there are a number of circumstances where this UPS protection fails:\n\nCable connection and software can fail.\n\nCable becomes disconnected\nSoftware isn't configured correctly\nSoftware doesn't start up\n\n\nUPS batteries degrade (normally within 2 years of installation in environments with regular power cuts) and there is too little capacity to run long enough for the computer to shut down gracefully after receiving the notification from the UPS\n\nLaptop computers tend to be much more resilient to power failure:\n\nA laptop's built-in 'smart' UPS is very reliable\nThe internal batteries last much longer than UPS batteries\nEven if the laptop internal battery degrades, the 'smart' function appears to work much more reliably than a standalone UPS communicating with a 'tower' computer.\n\nHere are some additional advantages of laptops vs. desktop machines:\n\nLower cost of freight:\n\nTo send the machine to site\nTo send spare parts for repair on-site\nTo retrieve the machine from site for any repairs that can not be undertaken on site\n\n\nIt is standard to have features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and camera included by default and this may not be the case with desktops\n\nA concern with laptop computers is security. It is easier to steal a laptop computer from an office than it is to steal a desktop computer. For this reason, laptops are normally configured with a physical locking feature such as Kensington lock slot.\nBecause Open mSupply is dealing with lots of numbers (quantities of stock), it is highly recommended to have a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Smaller laptop computers (14“ screen or less) will not have this. Smaller laptop computers normally have an impractically small screen. It is therefore recommended to procure a laptop computer with a keyboard that includes a numeric keypad - which will necessarily entail a larger screen.\nUseful productivity accessories for laptop computers include\n\nExternal mouse (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally irresponsible)\nExternal keyboard (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally irresponsible)\nExternal screen\n\n\nBackup system\nOnce you start using Open mSupply, it is of crucial importance that you have a method of backing up your data. In a default installation, Open mSupply stores all its data in a file that rapidly becomes large. You need, therefore, to have a high capacity removable storage device. We strongly recommend the use of an external hard disk using either firewire (IEEE 1394) or USB2 to facilitate off-site storage of backups.\n\nIf not using our internet backup service, you need to be able to store backed up data off-site to prevent the risk of loss by fire, theft, etc.\n\nAntivirus\nWindows based operating systems are particularly prone to malware if precautions are not taken. We recommend the following precautions:\n\nInstall a reputable anti-virus program, including web protection if the computer has access to the internet\nDisable USB ports - refer to this site for suggested methods\n\nEnsure that access to passwords to allow exceptions to the above two measures are kept secure.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tutorial/":{"body":"Open mSupply Tutorial\nThis tutorial is designed to guide you through the basics of using Open mSupply\nLogging in\n\nFor a start, you'll need to open your web browser. We like Firefox, but Chrome and its myriad children will also suffice.\nEnter the web address (URL) of your mSupply server. In our case we're using https://demo-open.msupply.org - our test web site.\nAfter pressing  on your keyboard you'll be shown the login page\n\n\n\nEnter your user name and password and press  on your keyboard, or click the [Log in] button\n\nAll going well, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page.\nIf there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:\n\nTry re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive).\nWhen you log in, the default store for your user is selected as the current store. If you have access to other stores, you'll be able to change stores after logging in (see below).\nIf you have logged in previously, and changed stores, then the most recent store will be selected for you when you log in.\nNavigating around\nThe main menu is on the left side of the screen. If you have a small screen size, then it will be collapsed by default - for larger screens it will instead be open by default.\nTo open and close you can click on the logo at the top, as shown below. The menu remains either open or closed once you have selected an option.\nIf the menu is closed, simply hovering over the menu items will open it, in which case clicking on an item will let the menu close again. If you are on a tablet, clicking on a menu item will have the same effect.\n\nOn some screens you'll see that the header shows a heading, such as Outbound Shipment in the example above. Clicking on a specific shipment then changes that heading to Outbound Shipment/ #[the shipment number]. You are able to click on the Outbound Shipment part to return to the list - or use the main navigation on the left.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThere are keyboard shortcuts used throughout open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination control (ctrl)+k (windows and linux) or cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nThis will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:\n\nThis shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing d on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).\nHowever, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:\n\nIn addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use control+1 to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or control+2 for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press + on your keyboard, you can add a new batch. \n\nFooter\nThe bottom of the screen contains some useful information and is shown on every screen\n\nSome users have access to more than one store. To change the store which is currently selected, simply click on the store name in the footer:\n\nYou will see the notification and the store name in the footer will be updated. From now, all actions will be in the newly selected store.\nHelp!\nIf you get stuck at any time when using the site, click on the Docs menu item. \n\nThis will take you to the documentation page which relates to the current page you are viewing.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/administration/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/administration/display/":{"body":137,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/administration/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/administration/synchronisation/":{"body":43,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/items/":{"body":331,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/catalogue/master-list/":{"body":28,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/dashboard/":{"body":115,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/customers/":{"body":46,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/outbound-shipments/":{"body":1836,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/distribution/requisitions/":{"body":157,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/introduction/":{"body":292,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/locations/":{"body":178,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-takes/":{"body":254,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/inventory/stock-view/":{"body":106,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/images/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/inbound-shipments/":{"body":1402,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/internal-orders/":{"body":678,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/replenishment/suppliers/":{"body":99,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/requirements/":{"body":687,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/tutorial/":{"body":305,"title":1}},"length":30},"lang":"English"};
