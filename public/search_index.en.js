For this reason, we recommend you keep the device connected to a power supply when using mSupply ColdChain.\nSensors\nManufacturer: Blue Maestro Model: DSCTHD001\n(There is a bug in the firmware of model DSCTEMP001 - The above model is the same electronics, but without the firmware bug)\nAlternative sensor: Laird BT510\nPermissions and peripherals\nThe first time you open mSupply ColdChain, it will guide you through enabling permissions and turning on required peripherals if they have not already been set correctly.\nIf devices are managed through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system, then the permissions described here will likely need to configured through a policy / profile in the MDM, and will not be configurable on the device as described here.\n\nAllow the application to access photos, media and files on your device: this will allow the export of log data to the device for report and email purposes.\n\n\n\nAllow the application to access this device’s location: this will allow the Android’s low energy Bluetooth to work.\nPressing OK will take you to the Location to ensure that it is turned on.\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm Bluetooth permission. Select Allow.\n\n\nOnce a sensor is linked to mSupply ColdChain, it will be automatically synchronised via Bluetooth according to the user-programmable schedule. mSupply ColdChain requires Bluetooth to be enabled in order to receive temperature logs. If Bluetooth is disabled when the application is operating, the user will be prompted to reconnect.\nIf the device is turned off, mSupply ColdChain is closed, or Bluetooth is disabled, the sensor will store up to 20,000 temperature logs as per the sensor settings. After 20,000 logs, the sensor will overwrite the oldest logs. When the device, mSupply ColdChain application or Bluetooth is enabled again, please allow a few log intervals for transfer of all saved logs.\nWe recommend that each device should be linked to a maximum of six sensors.

Using the slider, you can set the default log interval to any length between 1 and 100 minutes. \n\nThe logging interval applies for all sensors when they are first linked to the mSupply ColdChain application. Different log intervals can be set for each sensor in Available Sensors/Log interval (see below).\nFound sensors\nAny new sensors, not yet paired, will appear below this title. You can open new sensors by double-tapping anywhere on the sensor name/row.\nBlink: Pressing the blink button will cause the sensor light to flash. You can use this feature to ensure that you are connecting to the correct sensor.\nStart logging from: Using the date/time options, you can set the schedule for the first log. The sensor can be configured to start a maximum of 30 days from the link date. When you select OK, the application will link the sensor and move it to the Available Sensors section at the top of the Sensor Settings screen.\n\nAvailable sensors\nOnce a sensor has been linked to the mSupply ColdChain application, it will be displayed as an Available Sensor at the top of the screen. You can select a linked sensor by double-tapping on the sensor name/row or by pressing on “&gt;” in the device’s row.\n\nBlink: Pressing here will cause the sensor light to flash. You can use this feature to ensure that you are working with the correct sensor.\nDownload: Pressing here will trigger a manual download of all logs on the sensor.\nSensor Details: This provides the MAC address for the sensor (this is found on the back of the sensor). The current battery level will also be displayed as a percentage. Neither field can be edited.\nSensor name: Double-tap on sensor name/row or select the &gt; in the row to enter a new name for the sensor. This is the name that will appear on the Sensors tab. You should choose a name that makes it easy to identify (of course!).\n\nWe recommend you avoid the use special characters (e.g. -, +, *) in the sensor name.\nLog interval: The log interval will initially be set to the default log interval. Using the slider, you can change the interval between logs to any length between 1 and 30 minutes. When you press OK, the sensor will be reprogrammed with the new log interval.\n\nTemperature breach settings\nThere are two breach categories:\n\nSingle Exposure: any continuous period of time the temperature is outside the specified range.\nCumulative Exposure: the sum of time the temperature is outside the specified range during a period.\n\nTemperature breach settings apply to all sensors.\n\nSingle exposure breach configurations\nYou should set a minimum temperature (cold breach) and maximum temperature (hot breach) for the single exposure breaches.

This User Guide contains external links to Grafana information pages to explain various concepts and how to edit your current dashboard and create new dashboards.\nDashboards and Panels\nEach Dashboard is composed of editable Panels arranged on a grid. The panels are separated by rows and can be dragged-and-dropped to a different location on the grid. Each panel queries your mSupply data to give you information in a visual form (graph, table etc).\nStore login permissions to determine data visibility\nThe dashboards can be configured such that data visibility is controlled according to the store login permissions of the user. This can be an efficient way of managing dashboards. Instead of having a large range of very similar dashboards where the only difference between them is the user / store who's data is visible, you can have just one dashboard, where different users will see data according to the stores which they have permission to log in to.\nFlexibility\nYou can view and share data from your dashboard, change the appearance and type of data the panels in your dashboard show, and create new dashboards customised to suit your needs.\nFor a detailed overview refer to Grafana Dashboard Concepts\nSetting up Users\nYou can login to the dashboard using your current mSupply login. An account is created for you automatically in the grafana system with standard viewer-level permissions. If you are to have an editor or administrator role, then Sustainable Solutions, or another administrative user, can set that up for you after you have logged in for the first time.\nTo use the dashboard, an mSupply user must be configured to:\n\nUse the Dashboard.\n\n\n\nHave Active status enabled.\n\n\n\nIf your dashboard is filtering store data according to the user's permission to log in to the store (recommendethen you will need to:\n\n\nEnter an email address for the user.\n\n\n\nConfigure the user to be able to log in to the stores for which you want them to have access.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than these, no other special configuration of the mSupply user account is required - including any permissions in any of the stores.\n\nValid Grafana user names are more restrictive than mSupply. For example, if the mSupply user name contains a hyphen (-) then Grafana will not accept that user name.\n    John Doe **is** valid\n    John-Doe **is not** valid\n\nUsers may need to have their mSupply username, which was working perfectly, amended in order for them to be able to log in to the Dashboard.\nLogging In\nUsers log in by entering the URL address of dashboard on a web browser.\nThe oauth (mSupply login) app requires something that Internet Explorer doesn't support. You must use another browser to log in to the mSupply dashboards.\nAlso, just STOP USING Internet Explorer - it's dangerous!\nWhen you log in you may see a suite of dashboards similar to the example below.\nThis example is showing the 'Overview' Dashboard.\nIt is set to a Time Range of 'Previous year'\nThis Dashboard example contains six Panels:\n\nTotal stock value\nStock status\nStock value by store\nTransactions per store\nMonths of stock by region\nStock history over time by store\n\n\nNavigation menus\nLet's walk through the navigation menus\n\n\n\nOverview - This is the dashboard you are viewing.

You can choose to skip some of them to go directly to Confirm Shipped for example.\nAs demonstrated below, tap on the down arrow of the Confirm button and select the status you want the shipment to be updated to. \n\nAdding lines to an Outbound Shipment\nTap on the Add Item button (top right corner). \nA new Add Item window opens. \n\nSelect an Item\nIn the Add Item window, you can look up an item by:\n\nReading through the list of available items\nor by typing some or all of item name\nor by typing some or all of an item code\n\nOnce your item is highligthed, tap on the name or press Enter.\n\nOnce the item is selected, you can see the following information: \nHeaders\n\nItem code and name (eg. 030453 Amoxicillin 250 mg Tabs)\nthe available stock quantity for this item (eg. 3527 units)\nthe item's unit (eg. Tab)\n\n\nExample: For the item *030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs*, there are 3527 tabs available. \n\n\nIssue [Quantity] of units in packs of [Pack Size]\nIn the Issue Quantity field, you can enter the quantity that you want to issue to your customer. \nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units. However, you have the possibility to issue a quantity of packs instead by changing the value in the second dropdown (Pack Size). \nDefault value is Any when you are issuing units. \n\nList of available batches:\nThis is a list of batch numbers that you have in store for this item: \n\n# Packs: Number of packs to be issued\nPack Size: Quantity of units per pack\nUnit Qty: Total quantity of units to be issued\nAvailable: Number of packs available (not already allocated to other shipments)\nIn store: Total number of packs in your store\nBatch: Batch number. It is a designation given to products made in the same manufacturing run. \nExpiry: Expiry date of the batch (format: MM/YYYY)\nLocation: If you inventory is managed with storage locations, the name of the location where the item is stored\nSell: Selling unit price of the item\nOn Hold: Indicate whether a batch is on hold or not. You cannot issue a batch that is on hold. \nPlaceholder: The placeholder line is used when the quantity you are issuing is higher than your available stock\n\n\nIssue a quantity of units\nBy default, you are invited to issue a quantity of units, regardless of the pack size (number of units in a pack). \nWhen entering a number in the Issue Quantity field, system automatically chooses the batch number(s) with the shortest expiry date (First to Expire, First Out or FEFO logic). \n\nIn below example, we are issuing 100 units of the item. All 100 units will be taken from the same batch (second row). First batch was not selected because it is expired. \n\n\n\nIn this other example, we are issuing 1200 units. System selects two batches with different pack sizes. \n\n\nNote that in this list, the batches which are available for selection are shown first and batches which are not (on hold or no stock available) are shown below and in a grey font.\nIssue a quantity of packs\nYou can decide to issue a quantity of packs. To do this, you can change the value in the Pack Size dropdown. \n\nLet's imagine that your customer only wants pack size of 12 units. You can change the dropdown value from `Any` to `12`. \n\n\nYou are now offered to issue a number of packs of 12 units. Only batch number(s) with a pack size of 12 units can be automatically issued.\n\nIn below example, we are issuing 10 packs of 12 units:\n\n\n\n if you had previously entered a quantity of units and you switch to a quantity a packs, the quantity of units will automatically be converted into the correct quantity of packs.  \n\n\nWhen a pack size is selected, and stock lines which have a different pack size are not available for selection. As such, those rows are listed lower down in the table and are shown in a grey font, in the same way as other unavailable rows.\nManual Allocation\nRegardless if you chose to issue a quantity of units or packs, you can always manually change the quantity at the batch number level directly before pressing on OK. \nYou simply have to enter or edit the quantity in the # Packs column. \nThe main Issue Quantity field will be automatically updated with the new quantity.\n\n  when allocating quantities at the batch number level, the quantity you enter is always a quantity of packs. \n\n\n\nManual allocation at the batch number level.\n\nIssuing when there is not enough stock (Placeholder Line)\nIf the amount to be issued is greater than the total stock available from all of the available lines, then the quantity to be issued will automatically be placed in the placeholder field, at the bottom of the list of available batch numbers. \nPlaceholder lines can be allocated later when new stock arrives. However, all shipment lines must be allocated before confirming the allocation. \n\nSince there is no stock available for 042744-Diazepam Injection 5mg/ml Amp/2ml, system is issuing a 100 units in the placeholder field. \n\n\nWhen you look at an Outbound Shipment, you can see if a shipment line has not been allocated or has been partially allocated when it is higlighted in blue. \n\nConfirm Item and Quantity\nWhen you are happy with the quantity, you can either press on:\n\nthe OK button. You are redirected to the Outbound Shipment view and your item has been added to the list. \nthe OK &amp; Next button to add another item right away\nthe Cancel if you do not want to add the item to the Outbound Shipment anymore\n\nAdding lines to an Outbound Shipment using a Master List\nTap on the Add from master list button (top right corner). \n\nA new Master Lists window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).\nNote that the lists show are those which are visible to the customer of the shipment.\n\nClick OK on the prompt:\n\nYou will then have unallocated (placeholder) lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:\n\nAs you can see - all of the quantities are zero. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.\nEditing an Outbound Shipment Line\nTo edit an shipment line, tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status lower than Shipped. \n\n\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit. \n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Outbound Shipment you want to edit.\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list. \nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030063 - Acetylsalicylic Acid 100mg tabs\n\n\n\n  You can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nProcessing an Outbound Shipment\nAllocating an Outbound Shipment\nAllocation is the process of assigning one or multiple batch numbers from the inventory to a shipment line. In other words, you are assigning stock to your shipment. Once allocated, the stock is reserved for the shipment and thus for your customer. \nThere are 2 main ways to allocate a shipment line: \n\n\nWhen adding items, system is automatically assigning stock to the new shipment line when you enter a quantity. If you don't have enough stock, system will add placeholder lines (unallocated lines). \n\n\nBulk action Allocate placeholder lines: \n\nSelect the lines that you want to allocate by checking boxes on the right on the list\nIn the Actions dropdown menu, select Allocate placeholder lines. System will check if there is available stock for each selected lines and allocate them using the First to Expire, First Out (FEFO) logic. A notification will let you know whether the operation is successful or not. \n\n\n\n\nYou won't be able to process your Outbound Shipment if you have unallocated lines (shipment lines without batch number(s) assigned to it) with a quantity greater than 0. You can wait for more stock to arrive or you can delete the placeholder lines. Any unallocated lines with a 0 quantity will automatically be removed for you when you allocate.\n\nConfirming an Outbound Shipment's allocation\nOnce you all your shipments lines have been allocated, you can confirm the allocation:\n\nCurrent status of the shipment has to be NEW\nLines must be assigned with one or several batch numbers. You won't be able to confirm the allocation if your shipment contains lines without batch numbers assigned to it (placeholder lines). \n\nTo confirm the allocation, press the Confirm Allocated button. \n\nOnce the allocation is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is ALLOCATED\nYou are now invited to confirm the picking via the Confirm Picked button\nAll the items and their quantities will be reserved, meaning that they are no longer available for allocation\nYou can print a pick slip to be sent to your warehouse so they can start preparing the shipment\n\nConfirming Outbound Shipment picking\nPicking refers to the process where individual items are picked from a fulfillment facility (usually a warehouse or a pharmacy store).\nOnce a shipment has been allocated, next step is to go get the items to prepare the actual shipment. To help with that, you are able to generate a pick slip document. A pickslip indicates:\n\nWhat are the items to be picked\nThe quantity and batch numbers for each item\nIf you manage your inventory with storage locations, where the items are located\n\nOnce all items are picked and packed. You can then confirm the picking of the shipment to indicate to indicate that it is ready to be dispatched. \nTo confirm that a shipment has been picked, tap on the Confirm Picked button. \n\nOnce picking is confirmed:\n\nShipment status is now PICKED\nYou are now invited to confirm the shipping via the Confirm Shipped button\nAn Inbound Shipment has been generated and is now visible to your customer\n\nAt this stage, you are still able to edit shipment lines, to add items or to delete existing lines. However, if picking has been confirmed, you need to make sure to inform your fulfillment facility of any change so they can make sure that the shipment is still correct. \nConfirming the Outbound Shipment shipping\nThe last step to issue stock with an Outbound Shipment is to confirm that stock has been shipped. This a critical step cause when goods are confirmed as shipped, they are no longer part of your inventory records. \nTo confirm that an Outbound Shipment has been shipped, tap on the Confirm Shipped button. \nOnce shipping has been confirmed: \n\nShipment status is now SHIPPED\nGoods are  no longer part of your inventory\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\nYou can print a delivery note or an invoice\n\nTracking Progress of Outbound Shipments\nIf your customer is also using mSupply, you wil be able to see when they'll receive your shipments:\n\nstatus will become DELIVERED when goods are received: your customer confirmed that they received your goods\nstatus will become VERIFIED when shipment has been verified by your customer. Goods are now part of their inventory\n\nViewing an Outbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an outbound shipment, you will see the selected columns only.

These are created by the system when another store in the system creates an Outbound Shipment to deliver stock to your store. If this is the case you'll see a message near the top of the page:\n\nIf, however, you've created an Inbound Shipment manually, then the following message shows:\n\nand you'll see that the status bar has only the status values which apply to this type of shipment.\n\n    \n    Status Sequence: current status is New.\n\nIf you hover over the status sequence, a shipment history window appears.

The status which you can confirm depends on the current status of the shipment and follows the sequence shown below.\nWhen managing an Inbound Shipment, you can only confirm it as Delivered or Verified. \nConfirm...Current StatusNext Status\nConfirm DeliveredShippedDelivered\nConfirm VerifiedDeliveredVerified\n\nYou don't have to update a shipment to next status in the sequence. You can choose to skip some of them to go directly to Confirm Verified for example.\nAs demonstrated below, tap on the down arrow of the Confirm button and select the status you want the shipment to be updated to. \n\nAdding lines to an Inbound Shipment\nTo add a line, tap on the Add Item button located in the top left corner of your screen. \nA new Add Item window opens. \n\nSelect an Item\nIn the Add Item window, you can look up an item by:\n\nReading through the list of available items\nor by typing some or all of an item name\nor by typing some or all of an item code\n\nOnce your item is highlighted, tap on the name or press Enter.\n\nQuantities tab\nIn the Quantities tab, you can update the following fields: \n\nBatch: Type here the batch number. Leave blank if item is not managed with batch number.\nExpiry: The expiry date of the batch number. Leave blank is not applicable\n# Packs: The quantity of packs you are receiving\nPack Size: The quantity of units per pack (by default, pack size is 1)\nUnit Qty (read-only): Automatically calculated based on # Packs and Pack Size ([# Packs] x [Pack Size])\nIf you are receiving more than one batch number for the same item, you can tap on the Add Batch button\n\n\nIn below example, we are receiving 2 batch numbers for item 030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs with a different pack size. \n\n\nPricing tab\nOn the second tab, Pricing, you can update the following fields (all are optional): \n\nSell: The selling unit price of the item  (default value is 0)\nCost: The purchasing unit price of the item (default value is 0)\nUnit Qty (read-only): Total number of units for the batch number\nLine Total (read-only): Total purchasing value for the batch number ([Unit Qty] x [Cost]) \n\n\nSell &amp; Cost prices are per units and not per pack. \n\n\nIn below example, sell price $12 per unit and cost price is $10 per unit. \n\n\nLocation tab\nIn the third tab, Location, you can select a storage location to assign the batch number to a location in your storage facility. \nSimply select a storage location from the Location dropdown menu.\n\n\nDon't know the storage location yet ? You don't have to capture it right away. You can update the storage location at any time if you haven't confirmed the verification yet. \n\nConfirm item and quantities\nWhen you're done, you can add the new line by tapping on:\n\nOKif you don't want to add another line to your shipment\nOK &amp; Nextif you have other lines to create\n\nOtherwise, you can tap on Cancel and your changes won't be saved. \nAdding lines to an Inbound Shipment using a Master List\nTap on the Add from master list button (top right corner). \n\nThe button will be disabled if the status of the Inbound Shipment is anything other than New\n\n\nA new Master Lists window opens. This allows you to select the required master list. Simply click on one of the lists (if you have some available).\n\nClick OK on the prompt:\n\nYou will then have placeholder lines added to your shipment, which will then look like this:\n\nThe imported rows will have zero for the number of packs value, and are therefore shown in a blue font with the batch, expiry, location etc not shown. You can follow the steps for editing these lines, as detailed above.\nEditing an Inbound Shipment line\nTo edit an Inbound Shipment line, simply tap on it. You will be presented with the Edit Item window, which is identical to the Add Item window, except that the item is already chosen and cannot be modified. \nEdit a Shipment Line\n\n  you can edit a shipment line if the shipment has a status higher lower than Verified. \n\n\n\nOpen the Inbound Shipment you want to edit\n\n\nTap on the line you want to edit. An identical window to Add Item appears. At this stage:\n\nEdit the main Issue Quantity field \nor change the number of packs value at the batch number level\n\n\n\n\n  When editing a shipment line, you cannot change the item. You would need to delete the shipment line and to create a new one. \n\nDelete a Shipment line\n\nOpen the Inbound Shipment that you would like to edit\nMake sure that status is not yet VERIFIED\nSelect the line(s) you want to delete by checking the box(es) on the right of the list\nGo to the Actions dropdown menu (top right corner, above the list)\nSelect the action Delete selected lines\n\n\n\nIn below example, we are deleting item 030453 - Amoxicillin 250mg tabs\n\n\n\nYou can delete multiple lines at once. Be sure to review what is selected before performing the Delete action. \n\nReceiving stock with an Inbound Shipment\nConfirm the delivery of the shipment\nWhether your Inbound Shipment is manual or automatic, the first step to receive the goods is to confirm the delivery. \nAt this stage, you don't have to check if quantities or other information are correct, you just have to acknowledge that you have received the goods from your supplier. \nTo confirm that an Inbound Shipment has been delivered, click on the Confirm Delivered button. \n\nIn case your Inbound Shipment is automatic, you cannot confirm its delivery unless the supplier has confirmed its shipment. In other words, your shipment status has to be SHIPPED before you can confirm that you have received the goods. \n\n\nAny unallocated lines with a 0 number of packs value will automatically be removed for you when you confirm.\n\nVerify your Inbound Shipment\nVerification is the last step to receive goods in mSupply. At this stage, you can check what you have received and make sure that that information in mSupply are correct. \nYou have the possibility to verify the following information: \n\nBatch numbers and their expiry dates\nQuantity of packs and pack size \nPricing information: cost and sell prices\n\nYou can also capture where received goods are to be stored in the Location tab. \nOnce all information have been captured or verified, you can confirm the Shipment as VERIFIED by tapping on the Confirm Verified button. \nOnce you have done this:\n\nGoods are now part of your inventory\nShipment status is now VERIFIED\nYou can no longer edit shipment lines\nYou can no longer delete the shipment\n\nViewing an Inbound Shipment\nWhen viewing a specific shipment, you can view the batches on that shipment grouped by item or with each batch listed separately.\nTo change the view mode, click the Group by item switch. \nWhen grouped by item, you can expand the item to see individual batches, or use the expand in the table header to expand all grouped rows. If you click on an item you will also see all selected batches, as shown in this example:\n\nIf you do not have enough room on your screen, or simply aren't interested in some of the columns shown, you have the option of hiding which columns are shown in this view.\nClick on the Show / hide columns button which is at the top right of the table. This gives a list of the columns available - you can check the columns you want to see. The options chosen are stored for the current browser, so next time you view an inbound shipment, you will see the selected columns only. If you have chosen which columns to show, then the button is shown in blue to remind you that there are more columns available.\n\n","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/replenishment/inbound-shipments/","title":"Inbound Shipments"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/replenishment/internal-orders/":{"body":"Internal Orders go by several other names in certain countries or systems:\n\nRequisitions\nOrders\nReport &amp; Requisition\nR&amp;R\n\nInternal Orders are a way to support users in requesting new stock from another store. \nViewing Internal Orders\nIf you would like to order some stock from your supplier: \n\nNavigate to the Replenishment menu\nTap on Internal Orders\n\n\nYou will see a list of all existing internal orders: \n\nYou can use the Search by comment field to filter the list by the comments of the internal orders: \n\nYou can sort the list using the column headers:\n\nTap the column header of the column that you want to sort.

It can run on windows, mac or linux operating systems.\nHardware Requirements\nGeneral hardware recommendations\n\n\nIn environments with regular power outages, it is highly recommended to procure Laptop machines rather than desktop machines. Laptop machines will almost always be the best solution in terms of both cost and effectiveness for these reasons:\n\nIn environments with poor quality electricity supply, laptop computers will generally be more reliable than desktop computers with UPS protection. In such environments UPS batteries will normally die within 2 years. Laptop batteries have better power management and the batteries last longer\nEven when the battery runs out on a laptop, the power management will normally cause the machine to shut down gracefully. \nLaptop computers have built-in microphone and camera for provision of support\nLaptop computers have built-in Wi-Fi adaptor for network connection\nLaptop computers are smaller and lighter than desktop computers, and so are less costly to ship.\n\n\n\nA connected printer is not absolutely necessary in every situation, but for most situations it is a requirement. An ink-jet or laser is preferable.\n\n\nBuy hardware for which good after sales support is available\n\n\nBuy brands with a reputation for quality (even if it means buying a slower/older machine)\n\n\nWindows, Mac, and, Linux hardware requirements\nHardware requirements vary widely depending on what you want to use Open mSupply for. Here's a rough guide:\nMachineTechnical MinimumRecommended\nWindows Client machine for use with server64 bit processorWindows 104 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorWindows 108 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nMac Client machine for use with server64 bit processormacOS Mojave (10.14) – macOS Big Sur (11)(Latest release of major version is required, such as 10.14.6)4 Gb RAM, 300Mb of disk space64 bit processorMac OS 10.14.6 or later8 Gb RAM, 500Mb of disk space\nWindows server64 bit processorWindows 10 Pro or Win server 20198 Gb RAM50 GB HDD/SDD volume with daily backups to an external volume64 bit processorWindows Server 2019+8 Gb RAM4 x HDD/SDD volumes, 3 configured as RAID1 or RAID5 with hot spareDaily backups to the fourth volume plus daily off-site backupsAttached to a Smart UPS (see below)\nLinux client or server64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar4 Gb RAM256 Gb storage64 bit processorUbuntu 20+ or similar8 Gb RAM256 Gb storage\nAndroid client or server64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage64 bit processorAndroid 10 or later4 Gb RAM64 Gb storage\n\n\nRecording stock transactions is a core Open mSupply activity. Most stock transaction data is numeric. A numeric keypad is often helpful for machines that have a lot of data entry done on them.\n\nMobile / tablet requirements\nYou are able to use a browser on a tablet to connect to an open mSupply server, and the only requirement here is a suitably fast tablet with a browser such as chrome or firefox. \nFor a stand-alone, offline, solution a mobile application is also available for android devices.\nRecommended Specifications:\nIn short, open mSupply mobile runs on Android tablets (not on phones as there is too much data to use well on small phone screens).\nThe application requires at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop)\nMinimumRecommended\nDisplay size9.8 inches10.1 inches\nResolution768 x 1024 pixels800 x 1200 pixels\nAndroid version5.08.1\nProcessorQuad-core 1.3GHz\nMemory1.5 Gb RAM\n\nIn order to provide support, the device must also be compatible with MDM (Mobile Device Management) software and support google services. Please contact mSupply Foundation for details.\nPlease contact us for testing and / or advice before making a large hardware purchase.\nSmart UPS\nA 'smart' UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) detects when the battery power is about to run out and sends a notification to software on the server which triggers a graceful shut down of the computer. To enable this, there needs to be a cable connection (normally USB) between the UPS and the computer combined with software running on the computer.\nIn our experience, the primary cause of computer hardware failure is data corruption due to ungraceful shutdowns. This happens when power to the computer is cut instantly, without any notification to the computer to shut down gracefully. If the machine is 'protected' by a normal UPS, then this can still happen when the battery power runs out. Even if the machine is notionally protected by a 'smart' UPS, there are a number of circumstances where this UPS protection fails:\n\nCable connection and software can fail.\n\nCable becomes disconnected\nSoftware isn't configured correctly\nSoftware doesn't start up\n\n\nUPS batteries degrade (normally within 2 years of installation in environments with regular power cuts) and there is too little capacity to run long enough for the computer to shut down gracefully after receiving the notification from the UPS\n\nLaptop computers tend to be much more resilient to power failure:\n\nA laptop's built-in 'smart' UPS is very reliable\nThe internal batteries last much longer than UPS batteries\nEven if the laptop internal battery degrades, the 'smart' function appears to work much more reliably than a standalone UPS communicating with a 'tower' computer.\n\nHere are some additional advantages of laptops vs. desktop machines:\n\nLower cost of freight:\n\nTo send the machine to site\nTo send spare parts for repair on-site\nTo retrieve the machine from site for any repairs that can not be undertaken on site\n\n\nIt is standard to have features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and camera included by default and this may not be the case with desktops\n\nA concern with laptop computers is security. It is easier to steal a laptop computer from an office than it is to steal a desktop computer. For this reason, laptops are normally configured with a physical locking feature such as Kensington lock slot.\nBecause Open mSupply is dealing with lots of numbers (quantities of stock), it is highly recommended to have a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Smaller laptop computers (14“ screen or less) will not have this. Smaller laptop computers normally have an impractically small screen. It is therefore recommended to procure a laptop computer with a keyboard that includes a numeric keypad - which will necessarily entail a larger screen.\nUseful productivity accessories for laptop computers include\n\nExternal mouse (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal keyboard (not wireless - batteries replacement is expensive and environmentally problematic)\nExternal screen\n\nBackup system\nOnce you start using Open mSupply, it is of crucial importance that you have a method of backing up your data. In a default installation, Open mSupply stores all its data in a file that rapidly becomes large. You need, therefore, to have a high capacity removable storage device. We strongly recommend the use of an external hard disk using either firewire (IEEE 1394) or USB2 to facilitate off-site storage of backups.\n\nIf not using our internet backup service, you need to be able to store backed up data off-site to prevent the risk of loss by fire, theft, etc.\n\nAntivirus\nWindows based operating systems are particularly prone to malware if precautions are not taken. We recommend the following precautions:\n\nInstall a reputable anti-virus program, including web protection if the computer has access to the internet\nDisable USB ports - refer to this site for suggested methods\n\nEnsure that access to passwords to allow exceptions to the above two measures are kept secure.\n","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/roadmap/":{"body":"This road map will be updated about once every six weeks.\nIt only covers our immediate committed work stream.

When you do, you'll see that the button changes to a spinner and the progress is indicated with the stepper icons which change to show which step is currently active. For example, in the image below you'll see that Pull remote is active.\n\nHere is the complete process in action, with the steps slowed down.

We like Firefox, but Chrome and its myriad children will also suffice.\nEnter the web address (URL) of your mSupply server. In our case we're using https://demo-open.msupply.org - our test web site.\nAfter pressing  on your keyboard you'll be shown the login page\n\n\n\nEnter your user name and password and press  on your keyboard, or click the [Log in] button\n\nAll going well, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page.\nIf there was a problem, you'll see an error message, like this:\n\nTry re-typing the username and password (note that both are case-sensitive).\nWhen you log in, the default store for your user is selected as the current store. If you have access to other stores, you'll be able to change stores after logging in (see below).\nIf you have logged in previously, and changed stores, then the most recent store will be selected for you when you log in.\nNavigating around\nThe main menu is on the left side of the screen. If you have a small screen size, then it will be collapsed by default - for larger screens it will instead be open by default.\nTo open and close you can click on the logo at the top, as shown below. The menu remains either open or closed once you have selected an option.\nIf the menu is closed, simply hovering over the menu items will open it, in which case clicking on an item will let the menu close again. If you are on a tablet, clicking on a menu item will have the same effect.\n\nOn some screens you'll see that the header shows a heading, such as Outbound Shipment in the example above. Clicking on a specific shipment then changes that heading to Outbound Shipment/ #[the shipment number]. You are able to click on the Outbound Shipment part to return to the list - or use the main navigation on the left.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThere are keyboard shortcuts used throughout open mSupply. Rather than remember them all, to get started you simply have to remember the combination control (ctrl)+k (windows and linux) or cmd (⌘)+k (mac)\nThis will bring up the following window, no matter which page you are on:\n\nThis shows you the list of globally available shortcuts, for example pressing d on your keyboard will take you to the dashboard (unless you are entering text into an input field!).\nHowever, you can also click on an item in the list, or search available commands:\n\nIn addition - there are various places where specific keyboard shortcuts are available. An example is the tab control used in both Stocktakes and Inbound Shipments. Here you can use control+1 to navigate to the first tab (Quantities) or control+2 for the second tab (Pricing) etc. If you press + on your keyboard, you can add a new batch.\n\nFooter\nThe bottom of the screen contains some useful information and is shown on every screen\n\nSome users have access to more than one store. To change the store which is currently selected, simply click on the store name in the footer:\n\nYou will see the notification and the store name in the footer will be updated. From now, all actions will be in the newly selected store.\nHelp!\nIf you get stuck at any time when using the site, click on the Docs menu item.\n\nThis will take you to the documentation page which relates to the current page you are viewing.\n","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/docs/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/":{"body":"","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/","title":"mSupply mobile"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/images/":{"body":"","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/images/","title":"Catalogue"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/introduction/":{"body":"The original mSupply mobile docs are here\nWe are slowly transferring documentation (and updating it) over to this web site.\nSetting up mSupply Mobile on the device\n\nmSupply Mobile can be set up on your Android device by the mSupply Support Team or by your internal IT team with our support\n\nChoosing a device\nPreparing the device\nPreparing the device for mSupply is very dependant on factors including:\n\nThe make of the device\nThe version of Android running on it\nThe details of how the organisation plans to manage devices and communicate with users\n\nPlease consult with the mSupply Foundation support team ( support@msupply.org.nz ) on this. \nPlease note\n\nA device is typically allocated to a facility, NOT an individual user. As such ALL operating system (i.e. Android) user accounts set up on the device must be for the site, not a person. This way, if a person leaves and another person takes over operation of the device, and nothing should need to be changed.\nEach device running mSupply Mobile will correspond to one mSupply Store.\n\nInitialising the store\nAfter installing the mSupply Mobile app, you must initialise the data for the mSupply Store that the device is going to be used in. Most of the work is actually done by mSupply but you will need to set the store credentials on the device.\nWhen first syncing the new device the amount of records to sync may be large (say around 50,000). This could take hours to sync, especially over a poor internet connection. For this reason it is possible for you to limit how many months of transactions and stocktakes you want to include. Limiting the sync date range below explains how to limit the sync date range if this is required.\nWhen you open mSupply Mobile, the first screen looks as follows:\n\n\nPRIMARY SERVER URL: Please enter the correct URL for your mSupply Server, this uses HTTPS protocol for security. Forexample: https://your organisation.msupply.org\nSYNC SITE NAME: The site name as configured on the primary server.\nSYNC SITE PASSWORD: The password for the sync site as configured on the primary server.\n\nOnce you have entered the information, click Connect to start sync.\n\nInitialisation can take between 1 and 15 minutes depending on the number of records on the server related to the site being synced.\n\nOnce the server has found all the records to sync, mSupply Mobile will start pulling them between 20 and 500 records at a time depending on the connection speed. If the connection is lost or you close the app, you can resume sync where it stopped by entering the exact same details. Please note that if you enter different details, it will restart the sync completely!\nLogging in to the store\nOnce complete, you will be taken to the login screen. For guidance beyond here see the mSupply Mobile user guide.\nLimiting the sync date range\nWhen first syncing the new device the amount of records to sync may be large (say around 50,000). This could take hours to sync, especially over a poor internet connection. For this reason it is possible for you to limit how many months of transactions and stocktakes you want to include.\n\n\nChange the store Synchronisation type from collector to active or none to unlock editing custom fields.\nAdd a new line setting the Field label to syncMonths and the Field value to the number of months you wish to include.\nTo edit the custom field double-click on the line.\nChange the store Synchronisation type back to collector\n\nNow whenever a sync is carried out the store will only sync transactions and stocktakes for the previous X months. \n","id":"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"https://docs.msupply.foundation/mobile/server-setup/":{"body":"Setting up the server\nThe following details the steps of setting up mSupply from your organisation's mSupply Server\nNote - the mSupply Support Team will complete these steps for you.\nThe following instructions are for your information only.\nWhere to start\nRequirements\nA server running mSupply with a web server license registered\nSync server has a static IP and any network permissions required configured\nA mobile tablet fitting the recommended specifications here\n\nInformation needed\nStore name\nThe item master list to be attached to the store\nIf you are converting an existing mSupply site (customer) to mSupply Mobile, then you also need to provided the existing customer name that the store is being created for\n\nCreating mobile stores for new sites\nEACH individual mobile store needs to have the following steps done on the server, which are detailed later in this Server setup guide:\n\nCreate the sync site \nCreate the mobile store \nConfigure the mobile store section 4 of this guide\nCreate user(s) to access the store section 5 of this guide\n\nItems 1 and 2 can now be carried out using the Sync site wizard.
